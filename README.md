# SteamGameReviewApp

## What requirements did I achieve?
- I created the client entirely with React.
- I used Express to define GET and POST routes.
- I built a React form which users can use to submit reviews.
- I used React Router to create multiple dynamic pages for my SPA.
- I designed a database scheme and seeded the DB with some dummy game and review data.
- Reviews can be viewed per game which are pulled from the DB in an interval of 5 seconds.
- Both the game and review cards are dynamically rendered with the .map function.
- Reviews are filtered per game and each game has it's own dynamic page for reviews, this means that users can find reviews for the games they are interested in.

## Were there any requirements or goals that I was unable to achieve?
- Reviews cannot currently be deleted since accounts cannot be made, therefore, it would seem silly to give users the power to delete any review they want.
- Reviews cannot be liked, I would have implemented this but I ran out of time.
